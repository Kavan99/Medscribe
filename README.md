Mediscribe - AI-Powered Medical Prescription Platform
Website: https://mediscribe.in


**Overview**
Mediscribe is an AI-Powered Solution curated for medical professionals to empower them with effortless Prescription Documentation
Mediscribe automates medical prescription documentation with 98% accuracy, eliminating manual paperwork while maintaining clinical precision. The platform offers two intelligent solutions for healthcare providers:​
1) Audio-to-Prescription: Transforms doctor-patient conversations into structured prescriptions
2) OCR-to-Digital: Digitizes handwritten prescriptions and seamlessly integrates with hospital EHR systems

**How It Works**
_**Audio-to-Prescription Workflow**_
Step 1: Ambient Listening & Transcription
Natural doctor-patient conversations in real-time is transcribed into structured Rx. The AI-powered transcription engine handles medical terminology, accents, and background noise, converting speech to text with high clinical accuracy.​
Step 2: Intelligent Data Extraction
The system analyzes the conversation and automatically identifies key clinical elements: patient demographics (name, age, gender), symptoms and medical history, diagnosis (e.g., "acute bronchitis"), prescribed medications with dosages and frequency, and follow-up instructions.​
Step 3: Structured Prescription Generation
Using medical-optimized AI, Mediscribe transforms raw data into standardized clinical documentation. It organizes information into SOAP format, infers missing details (e.g., suggests standard 500mg dosage if unspecified), flags inconsistencies like missing dosage information or potential drug interactions, and ensures compliance with clinical best practices.​
Step 4: Review & Integration
Clinicians review and validate the generated prescription before finalizing. The output can be digitally signed, printed, or directly integrated with EHR systems.​

_**Handwritten Prescription OCR Workflow**_
Step 1: Image Processing
Accepts uploaded images of handwritten prescriptions and applies advanced preprocessing techniques including adaptive thresholding, noise reduction, and contrast normalization to enhance text visibility.​
Step 2: OCR Recognition
Multiple OCR passes with handwriting-specific optimizations extract text from prescriptions. The system recognizes medical terminology from a comprehensive database of medications, dosages, administration routes, and frequency terms, makinf the best estimate of fuzzy handwriting
Step 3: EHR Auto-Fill
Digitized prescription data automatically populates EHR forms, eliminating manual data entry and reducing errors.​
